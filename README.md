# ft_containers
 The multiple available containers in C++ all have a very different usage. To make sure you understand them all, let's re-implement them!

You have to reimplement the following C++ containers:
- [x] Vector ([std::vector])
- [x] Stack ([std::stack])
- [x] Map ([std::map])

STL is not allowed. That means you cannot you cannot use `<iterator>` or even `<utility>`.

My map/set implementations all use the RBT.hpp file in this repository as the
underlying datastructure. It is a self-balancing binary search tree. All operaations on the tree are
log n as the C++ specification requires it to be.

Bonus:
- [x] Set ([std::set])

This implementation comes with a large set of tests in the tests directory.

[std::stack]: http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stack/stack
[std::map]: http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/map/map
[std::set]: http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/set/set
